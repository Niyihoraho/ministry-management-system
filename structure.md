# Christian Organization Management System Design

## Improvements to Hierarchy & Structure (2024 Review)

- **Leaders/Admins Only:** Only leaders and administrators at each level (National, Regional, Campus, Small Group, Graduate Network) are system users. Students and graduates are not users and do not have system access.
- **Clarified Roles:** Reviewed and clarified leadership roles to avoid redundancy (e.g., ensuring distinct responsibilities for Campus Leader and Small Group Coordinator). Alumni network access is limited to Alumni Coordinator and Graduate Group Leaders only.
- **Super Admin Role (Optional):** Added an optional "Super Admin" role for technical/system-level management (user provisioning, system settings, emergency access).
- **Role Request & Approval Workflow:** Introduced a role request feature, allowing new leader appointments to be requested and approved by the next level up, ensuring proper authorization.
- **Access Control Improvements:** Each leader/admin only sees and manages data for their level and below. Optional "View Only" roles can be added for auditors or external reviewers if needed.
- **Audit Trail:** All approvals, changes, and assignments are logged for accountability and transparency.
- **Emergency Access Protocol:** Emergency access protocol for urgent situations (e.g., if a leader is unavailable) is recommended.

## Member and Contributor Tracking (2024 Update)

- **Internal Members:** Students and graduates are now tracked as internal members in the system. Their attendance (bible study, discipleship, evangelism, small group, etc.) and contributions are recorded for reporting and engagement analysis. Internal members are not system users, but their participation and giving are recognized and managed.
- **External Contributors/Supporters:** Individuals who are not internal members (such as ministry supporters, donors, or event participants) are tracked as contributors. Their donations, event registrations, and support are recorded, even though they do not have system accounts.
- **System Users:** Only leaders and admins (as previously defined) have system accounts and access. They manage members, contributors, attendance, and reporting.
- **Reporting:** The system supports reporting on contributions and attendance by member, supporter, campus, region, event, and more, providing a comprehensive view of organizational engagement and support.
